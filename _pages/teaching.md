My teaching philosophy centers on fostering critical thinking and active learning. I engage students by asking thoughtful questions that fosters deep reflection and connections between concepts and practice. I also emphasize applying statistical methods to real-world problems to reinforce understanding through relevance and application.

Independent Study (NURSING 922 Special Reading)
-----
I offer small-group independent studies (2â€“3 students) that make advanced statistical modeling both accessible and directly relevant to your research. 
Each group centers on a specific method, with structured, hands-on learning in a supportive peer environment. This format fosters community among doctoral students, helps you apply complex techniques to your dissertation, and provides a clear path to completing projects within a semester. 
If your research could benefit from one of the statistical models listed below, please reach out for more details.
